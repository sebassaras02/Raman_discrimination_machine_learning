## Guidelines

There are available three things that a user must be interested:
1. Raw data (Essential oils 1st part, Essential oils 2nd part, Essential oils 3rd part, and Essential oils 4th part folders)
2. Average spectra (Average spectra folder)
3. Data science and models creation (Jupyter notebooks)

### Raw data:

In each folder there is several Raman spectra collected for different samples.

### Average spectra

It is the average spectra calculated for each sample according to the dose and irradiation stage.

### Jupyter notebooks

There are three notebooks which are focused in the data engineering, modeling, and model evaluation. 

## Nomenclature used in the data

The essencial oils come from chilca and muña. For label the files it was used the following structure.

MI = Irradiated raw material (It means that the plant material was first irradiated and then the oil was extracted)

AI = Oil Irradiate (It means that the oil is extracted and then it is irradiated)

The numbers shows the irradiation dose in kGy.

The "calibration" folder contains the spectra that simply served as verification that the equipment was calibrated.

SD - standard deviation
Av - average
third letter m - Muña
third letter c - Chilca
forth letter m - MI Materia Prima
forth letter a  - AI Aceite Irradiada
